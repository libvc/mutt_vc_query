mutt_vc_query - vCard query utility for mutt
release 002

Copyright (C) 2003  Andrew Hsu

Note: If you are compiling mutt_vc_query from source code, you must
have had installed the latest libvc package.  In order for the
compiler to use the libvc libraries, you may have to export the
following environment variables before you run configure:

   $ export LDFLAGS=$LDFLAGS" -L/usr/local/lib"
   $ export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS" -I/usr/local/include"

Replace the respective directories above with whatever paths you
have installed libvc and the header file into.

Once mutt_vc_query has successfully compiled and installed, add the
following line to your ~/.muttrc file:

  set query_command="mutt_vc_query '%s'"

And you will then be able to query email addresses stored in your
local `contacts.vcf' file from mutt when you use the `Q' command.
