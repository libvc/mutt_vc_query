mutt_vc_query 001 (2003-05-14)

* Initial release.  This is the same query_command utility that was
included with previous versions of rolo.  The mutt_vc_query utility
is now split-off into its own package.  The search results returned
are now guaranteed to have a name and an email address.  The
miscellaneous field can now be configured with the -t option.  The
man page has been updated.  Note: for those who wish to compile
mutt_vc_query from the source, it is now dependent on libvc.  So,
be sure libvc is installed on your system before compiling
mutt_vc_query.
