provisions for running it through "make check".

mutt_vc_query 003 (2017-02-18)

* Add -a option to output all email addresses instead of just the
preferred address  (patch by Matthew Hague <matthewhague@zoho.com>)

mutt_vc_query 002 (2003-05-19)

* Updated the man page.

* Fixed the output of `mutt_vc_query -h' so that it displays properly.

* Queries are now performed as a case insensitive search.

mutt_vc_query 001 (2003-05-14)

* Initial release.  This is the same query_command utility that was
included with previous versions of rolo.  The mutt_vc_query utility
is now split-off into its own package.  The search results returned
are now guaranteed to have a name and an email address.  The
miscellaneous field can now be configured with the -t option.  The
man page has been updated.  Note: for those who wish to compile
mutt_vc_query from the source, it is now dependent on libvc.  So,
be sure libvc is installed on your system before compiling
mutt_vc_query.
